# Sentiment-Analysis-on-twitter-review
Classification using Naive Bayes and Logistic
We have twitter reviews and we need to review whether it is positive or negative .
First we have made each review as a document and then transformed all documents into bag of words in a csv file and used its count-frequency and binomial frequency to use in as Naive Baye's classifier and logistic classifier.
We used cross entropy as loss function and gradient descent.
These were all built from scratch.
